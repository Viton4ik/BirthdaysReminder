# Birthdays Reminder
## _Private telegram bot_
#### ✨ _Idea_ :✨
The main idea of using the Birthdays Reminder application is to be informed about people's birthdays through telegram!

- The script is written in Python and aims to send birthday reminders via Telegram. 
- It reads a list of birthdays from an Excel file and sends messages to the specified Telegram chat IDs.
- It checks for upcoming birthdays and sends reminders to the appropriate chat IDs. 
- It can also send images along with the message.

```
Usage of getinfo.py
```
- Once you have run this code, you should see the response from the API in JSON format printed to the console. 
- The response will contain information about any updates for your bot, such as new messages or other events and chat IDs.
